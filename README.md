this project scrapes the PGA webpage for the average driving distance for each PGA pro, ranking them from highest driving distance average to the lowest. It does this by using
HtmlAgilityPack and Regrex to determine whenever the scraped information is a player's name or not, it then uses this information to pair the player to their respective driving
distance.
